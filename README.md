# RSS-Server
## Introduction
A local RSS provider server built with PyGithub, etc. My 1st personal project. Crafted with heart. Commits & comments are welcome.

Working well with any repo you'd like to trace, it can also collaborate with Docusarus and any static-page builder provided by your CDN. Linked with your repo on Github, from your commit comments it will generate a RSS source, which can be given away by local Nginx server then. 



## Milestones:
- [x] Github authentication & RESET Api interaction 
- [x] Sqlite as config & log database
- [x] Command line interaction
- [ ] RSS xml building
- [ ] Subscriber e-mailing api
- [ ] Security enhancements
